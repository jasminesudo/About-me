            <p>This is my first time actually publishing a website, so please enjoy!</p>
            <p>My name is Jasmine. I have a slight intrest for things like coding and robotics, but I really like drawing much more. I really like snakes, except I often end up doodling a bunch of animals I call "beaked snakes" because they look like snakes with beaks, if that makes any sense. If you wanna read more, go I advise going to the yapping channel!
                Although I am not  the best at math, I still have to do it. =T^T=

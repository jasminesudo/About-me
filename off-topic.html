        <p>Now, although this IS a off-topic channel (yes I am calling these channels) I will stay a little on topic, even if this does contridict
                the channel name. :3 I play the flute. One time, I asked my band director: "How do you play the high notes softly?" because my music told
                me to do that, and he said something like: "Even professionals have trouble playing the high notes soft and the low notes loud."
                
         </p>

    Another time, I got a email from some random person, and (I'm pretty sure 67 is still trending in 2025) he sent me probably 1000 67's. I already have
    enough with my brainrot friends (although they're my friends, so I guess they don't really count) and I get a buttload of 67's, sent right to my email!
    (Sorry I feel like this is more like a complaining channel I'll stop now)

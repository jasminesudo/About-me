         <p>I was aiming for a cat, but it look like it got smooshed...</p>
         <p>Anyways, this is the yapping channel! This is the last channel I am making for the day, so I am going to make
            this pretty quick. Sorry! I'll add more later, but my computer does NOT have too much time!
            Anyways, as I was talking about robotics and stuff in the home channel, I am really interested!
            Except there isn't too many jobs for robotics and coding, because AI is going to replace all of it!!! So I am
            kinda sad. So I'm doing this as a hobby! :3 problem solved! (except, not quite.)
